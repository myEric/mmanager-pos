# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file, in reverse chronological order by release.

## 3.0.0 - 2018-03-15

### Added

- [#30](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-zendrouter/pull/30) and
  [#35](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-zendrouter/pull/35) add
  support for the zend-expressive-router 3.0 series.

- [#34](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-zendrouter/pull/34)
  adds `Zend\Expressive\Router\ZendRouter\ConfigProvider` and exposes it as a
  config provider within the package definition.

### Changed

- [#41](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-zendrouter/pull/41)
  updates the minimum supported version of zend-expressive-router to 3.0.0rc3
  and later.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- [#30](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-zendrouter/pull/30)
  removes support for the zend-expressive-router 2.0 series.

- [#30](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-zendrouter/pull/30)
  removes support for PHP 5.6 and PHP 7.0.

### Fixed

- [#37](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-zendrouter/pull/37)
  fixes an issue with how a failure result is marshaled when the path patches
  but the request method does not. The package now correctly aggregates allowed
  methods for the route result failure instance.

- [#40](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-zendrouter/pull/40)
  fixes how the router creates a `RouteResult` when the path matches, but not
  the HTTP method. In particular, it does not provide special handling for
  `HEAD` requests, treating them like any other method mismatch.

### Fixed

- [#20](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-zendrouter/pull/20)
  fixes an import statement in `ZendRouter` to ensure the correct exception
  namespace is used.

## 2.0.0 - 2017-01-11

### Added

- [#16](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-zendrouter/pull/16)
  adds support for zend-expressive-router 2.0. This includes a breaking change
  to those _extending_ `Zend\Expressive\Router\ZendRouter`, as the
  `generateUri()` method now expects a third, optional argument,
  `array $options = []`.

  For consumers, this represents new functionality; you may now pass router
  options, such as a translator and/or translation text domain, via the new
  argument when generating a URI.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- Nothing.

### Fixed

- Nothing.

## 1.3.0 - 2016-12-14

### Added

- Nothing.

### Changed

- [#12](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-zendrouter/pull/12)
  updates the zend-expressive-router dependency to 1.3.2+

- [#12](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-zendrouter/pull/12)
  updates the router to compose the `Zend\Expressive\Router\Route` instance
  associated with a successful route match in the returned `RouteResult`. This
  allows you to access other route metadata like the path, allowed HTTP methods,
  and route options.

- [#12](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-zendrouter/pull/12)
  updates the router to always support `HEAD` and `OPTIONS` requests made to any
  valid route. Dispatchers will need to check if such requests are supported
  explicitly or implicitly by the matched route (using `Route::implicitHead()`
  and `Route::implicitOptions()`).

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- Nothing.

### Fixed

- Nothing.

## 1.2.0 - 2016-08-11

### Added

- Nothing.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- This release removes support for PHP 5.5.

### Fixed

- [#7](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-zendrouter/pull/7)
  updates the zend-router dependency to `^3.0`; this also required changing
  which routes and routers are imported internally to use the new namespace
  introduced in that version. The changes should have no effect on existing
  code, except that they will result in dependency updates.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

### Fixed

- [#3](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-zendrouter/pull/3) fixes
